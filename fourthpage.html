            You make me happy in a way that no one else can. You have this way
            of making everything right, kahit na magulo na ang lahat. Having you
            makes me feel like I'm enough. Thankyou for making me feel safe,
            listening at my rants, understanding me even when I can't find the
            right words. No one else can do all of that, no one else has ever
            made me feel this kind of love, the peace. I am always grateful. I
            hope you know na kahit hindi ko laging nasasabi, your presence means
            so much to me ^_^
          </p>
          <p>
            You make me happy just by being you, by being with you, by letting
            me in your world.
